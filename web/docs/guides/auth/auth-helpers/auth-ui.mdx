Stripe Elements is a set of prebuilt UI components for building your web checkout flow. It’s available as a feature of Stripe.js, our foundational JavaScript library for building payment flows. Stripe.js tokenises sensitive payment details within an Element without ever having them touch your server.

Elements features include:

Automatic input formatting as customers type
Complete UI translations to match your customer’s preferred language
Responsive design to fit seamlessly on any screen size
Custom styling rules so you can match the look and feel of your site
