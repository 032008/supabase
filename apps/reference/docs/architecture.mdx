Supabase is open source. We choose open source tools which are scalable and we make them simple to use.

## Philosophy

Supabase is not a 1-to-1 mapping of Firebase. While we are building many of the features that Firebase offers, we are not going about it the same way.

Our technological choices are quite different from Firebase. Everything we use is open source. Wherever possible, we use and support existing tools rather than developing from scratch.

Most notably, we use Postgres rather than a NoSQL store. This choice was deliberate. We believe that no other database offers the functionality required to compete with Firebase,
while maintaining the scalability required to go beyond it.

## Architecture

Each Supabase project consists of several open source tools.

### PostgreSQL (Database)

PostgreSQL is the core of Supabase. We do not abstract the PostgreSQL database, you can access it and use it with full priveleges. We simply provide
tools which makes Firebase as easy to use as Firebase.

## Product Principles

Our goal is to provide an architecture which a large-scale company would eventually design for themselves,
and then offer tooling around this architecture to make it easy for indie-developers and small teams to use.

While scalability and usability are often opposing goals, we use a series of principles to ensure that there is never a trade-off:

### Everything works in isolation

Each system must work as a standalone tool with as few moving parts as possible.
The litmus test for this is: “Can a user run this product with nothing but a Postgres database?”.

### Everything is integrated

Supabase is composable. Even though every product works in isolation, each product on the platform needs to 10x the other products.
For integration, each tool should expose an API and Webhooks.

### Everything is extensible

We're very deliberate about adding a new tool, and prefer instead to extend an existing one.
This is the opposite of many cloud providers whose product offering expands into niche use-cases. We provide _primitives_ for developers, which allow them to achieve any goal.
Less, but better.

### Everything is portable

To avoid lock-in, we make it easy to migrate in and out. Our cloud offering is compatible with our self-hosted product.
We use existing standards to increase portability (like pg_dump an CSV files). If a new standard emerges which competes with a "Supabase" approach, we will deprecate the approach in favor of the standard.
This forces us compete on experience. If we are not the best Postgres hosting service, then developers deserve to migrate away.

### Play the long game

We sacrifice short-term wins for long-term gains. For example, it is tempting to run a fork of Postgres with additional functionality which only our customers need.
Instead, we prefer to support efforts to upstream missing functionality so that the entire community benefits. This has the additional benefit of ensuring portability.

### Build for developers

"Developer" is a very specific profile of user.
Developers are _builders_. When we look at their impact vs effort, they are the type of user who can build products and systems with the largest efficiency.
As the profile of a developer changes, we will continue to evolve the product to suit the evolving profile.

### Support existing tools

Supabase supports existing tools and communities wherever possible. This is the promise of open source.
