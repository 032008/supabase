You can validate incoming files and only allow certain types or size to succeed the upload.

## Global File Size
You can set the max file size across all your buckets by setting this global value in the Admin Studio.
You'll find this option under Settings > Storage > Max File Size.

For Free projects it cannot exceed 50MB. On the Pro Plan, you can set this value to up to 50GB to allow file uploads larger than 50MB.

Remember, this option is a global limit, which applies to all your buckets.
You can additionally specify the max file size on a per [bucket level](/guides/storage/buckets/creating-buckets#restricting-uploads) but it cannot be higher than this global limit.

It is a good practice to have the Global limit set to the highest possible file size that your application would accept, and always apply per bucket limits which can be lower.

## Per Bucket Restrictions

You can have different restrictions on a per bucket level.
You are able to restrict the file types such as: `pdf`,`images`,`videos` and the max file size which should be lower then the Global Limit.

To apply these limit on a bucket level see [Creating Bucket](/guides/storage/buckets/creating-buckets#restricting-uploads)
